# DistanceStats
Currently, the program supports Hierarchical Clustering (AGNES) with four distance metrics, simple distance calculation and distance caulculation in comparison to given cities.

You will need a PBF file of Israel for the program to work. A suitable file can be obtained here: https://download.geofabrik.de/asia/israel-and-palestine.html. By default, the program searches for this file on the desktop of the current user.
